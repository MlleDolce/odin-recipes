    <h4>This delicious keto bar is only made of 3 ingredients.</h4>
    <p>Buying keto snacks and energy bars from specialty health food stores can be very pricey and feel unsustainable for so so many of us with limited budgets.
        Fortunately preparing keto snacks at home can be quite easy and does not need to break the bank. All you need for this recipe is baker's chocolate, almond butter, and keto maple syrup. 
        And I guarantee that your taste buds will be thanking you for the small amount of time invested into this kitchen endeavor. You will be hard pressed to find a commercial keto bar
    that is this tasty. Courtesy of <a href="https://thebigmansworld.com/homemade-keto-chocolate-crunch-bars-paleo-vegan-low-carb/" target="_blank">The Big Man's World</a> website.</p>
