    <p>
      Buying keto snacks and energy bars from specialty health food stores can
      be very pricey and feel unsustainable for so so many of us with limited
      budgets. Fortunately preparing keto snacks at home can be quite easy and
      does not need to break the bank!</p>
      <p>All you need for this recipe is baker's
      chocolate, almond butter, and keto maple syrup. And I guarantee that your
      taste buds will be thanking you for the small amount of time invested into
      this kitchen endeavor. You will be hard pressed to find a commercial keto
      bar that is this tasty. Recipe courtesy of
