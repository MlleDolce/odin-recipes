          <h2 id="recipe-guide">Instructions</h2>

          <h3>Preparing the eggplant:</h3>
          <ol>
            <li>
              Preheat oven to 400 degrees F and place oven rack to the middle
              position. Line a sheet pan with parchment paper.
            </li>
            <li>
              Slice the eggplant lengthwise, salt well and let sit for 15
              minutes to remove the bitter juices. Rinse quickly, then pat dry.
              Place the eggplant cut side down and roast 45 minutes or until the
              eggplant is completely tender when pierced with a fork. Remove
              from the oven and cool
            </li>
          </ol>
          <h3>Baba Ganoush:</h3>
          <ol>
            <li>
              Scoop the soft eggplant pulp from the skin and place into a food
              processor. Pulse to break-up. Add the other ingredients and run
              the processor until the dip is smooth and creamy.
            </li>
            <li>
              Taste and adjust seasoning. Serve immediately or cover and
              refrigerate up to 5 days. It tastes better the next day! Serve at
              room temperature or slightly warm. Makes 1 1/2 – 2 cups or 3-4
              tbsp per person.
