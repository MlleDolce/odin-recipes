    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 head cauliflower, cut into florets</li>
        <li>2 Tablespoons extra virgin olive oil, divided use, optional</li>
        <li>2 small limes, juiced</li>
        <li>1 bunch fresh cilantro leaves, chopped</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Place cauliflower florets into the Vitamix container and add just enough water so the cauliflower floats above the blades. Secure the lid.</li>
        <li>Select Variable 6. Pulse 5 times or until you have small pieces resembling rice. Strain and pat dry with a towel to remove excess water.</li>
        <li>Working in two batches, add 1 Tablespoon olive oil to a large non-stick skillet set over high heat. Add half the cauliflower to the pan and cook for 3 to 5 minutes. Remove from heat and set aside in a separate bowl.</li>
        <li>Add remaining 1 Tablespoon olive oil to the skillet, followed by remaining uncooked cauliflower. Cook for 3 to 5 minutes, then combine all cooked cauliflower in a bowl and season with cilantro and lime juice.</li>
    </ol>
